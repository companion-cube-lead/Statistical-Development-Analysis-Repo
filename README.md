# Statistical-Development-Analysis-Repo
This repository is designed as a showcase to demonstrate how data can be extracted from Jira and analyzed by using linear models using R (University of South Florida). 
The repo provides evidence to support the intuition that storypoints are lineaerly correlated to time. It also provides a methodology to quantitatively measure velocity as a function of the time reported in Jira for stories which are being worked on over the course of a sprint.    
Furthermore, a combination of R packages are introduced to integrate it with existing cloud resources such as Azure and push it to external reporting tools such as PowerBi.
